## **ping_pong
###**This game was inspired by the computer game Pong, which was released in November 1972 by the Atari company. The game is a basic computerized version of table tennis. I used the turtle module in Python to accomplish this. The construction of this game was influenced by my exposure to and in-depth study of the language.
